The following provisions describe the type, scope and purpose of collecting, processing and utilizing personal data. This data privacy policy applies only to my web pages.

<br/><h2>Inventory data</h2>
<p>(1) Your personal data, insofar as these are necessary for this contractual relationship (inventory data) in terms of its establishment, organization of content and modifications, are used exclusively for fulfilling the contract. For goods to be delivered, for instance, your name and address must be relayed to the supplier of the goods. <br/>
  (2) Without your explicit consent or a legal basis, your personal data are not passed on to third parties outside the scope of fulfilling this contract. After completion of the contract, your data are blocked against further use.

  <h2>Web analysis with Piwik</h2>
  <p>This website uses Piwik Analytics, a web analysis service of the Radon Cloud. Piwik Analytics uses cookies, i.e. text files stored on your computer to enable analysis of website usage by you. Information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a server in Amsterdam, Netherlands and stored there. Because of activated IP anonymization on this website, however, your IP address is previously truncated within member states of the European Union or in other states which are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is a full IP address transmitted to the server and truncated there. On behalf this website's owner, the Radon Cloud will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports about website activities, and provide the website's operator with further services related to website and Internet usage. The IP address sent from your browser as part of Analytics is not merged with other data by the Radon Cloud. You can prevent storage of cookies by appropriately setting your browser software; in this case, however, please note that you might not be able to fully use all functions offered by this website.<br/><br/>This website uses Analytics with the extension &quot;anonymizeIP()&quot;, IP addresses being truncated before further processing in order to rule out direct associations to persons. For Example your Public IP, 93.217.49.122, is transmitted and saved as 93.217.0.0.</p><br/>

  <h2>Information about cookies</h2>
  <p>(1) To optimize my web presence, I use cookies. These are small text files stored in your computer's main memory. These cookies are deleted after you close the browser. Other cookies remain on your computer (long-term cookies) and permit its recognition on your next visit. This allows us to improve your access to my site.<br/>(2) You can prevent storage of cookies by choosing a &quot;disable cookies&quot; option in your browser settings. But this can limit the functionality of my Internet offers as a result.</p><br/>
  <h2>Social plug-ins from Twitter</h2>
  <p>With Twitter and its Retweet functions, I use social plug-ins from Twitter.com, operated by Twitter Inc. 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107. If you use Retweet, the websites visited by you are announced to third parties and associated with your Twitter account.
